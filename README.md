# Interactive map
https://geo-corps.github.io/otter_map/

The interactive map is being built in the index.html file - it currently uses a style from Marena's Studio account but this can be switched out in the code by changing access token, style ID, tileset IDs etc. Need to make sure layer names and column names (in popup html) are the same.
