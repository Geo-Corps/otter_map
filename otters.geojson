At the end of the dock, they stretched their long necks out of the water to look at me, as if for the first time, and dove.

I went back the next day to try and get some pictures. That day (Dec 11), the otter spent much of an hour energetically swimming around the pond in pursuit of food, occasionally going to shore to feast on its unfortunate victims. I just loved tracking its underwater movement by following the trail of air bubbles, and hearing its inhalations during brief trips to the surface. The highlight was watching it chow down on a big fish - I could even hear crunching! I'm not sure what else it might have been eating. A few times, it got out onto the shore and walked around briefly before going back into the pond.<br /><br />I didn't return to the pond until a month later on January 13, 2012. I was surprised to find the otter at the pond. I thought it would have exhausted the food supply within a week or so. On Jan 13, the otter was eating something when I arrived, but it soon disappeared. <br /><br />I talked to a woman sometime in April who said she visits Healdsburg Ridge almost every day.

When they noticed me, they ducked under the water and resurfaced about 20-30 feet away. They wrestled together, resurfacing and ducking under to swim, much like seals. At one point one resurfaced with a small fat fish and ate it much like the crab--body vertical in the water and nose pointed skyward, chomping on the fish. I saw this happen twice.

This is the spot where a small tributary from the town of Tomales enters Walker Creek. They stayed at this one spot for about 7 minutes and rarely swam into the main channel. I observed two small silver fish caught and eaten while in the water. They made a lot of noise in the water by splashing and rooting around the bank. They were aware of me as I sat on the opposite bank but did not seem concerned. They did not rest, preen, or go onto dry land very often as they seemed pretty intent on foraging. They then continued downstream and I left knowing that I would be able to observe them at site #2.<br /><br />As you stand on the bridge at site #2 you can see upstream for about 400 yards. There is little vegetation/cover at the waters edge. As the otters swam and forgaged toward me they stayed in the deep water on the bank nearer to Hwy 1. As I was standing on the bridge in plain view they were aware of me but did not seem concerned and would float about 20 yards from me uptream of the creek and look at me. Each time they would dive to forage as they surfaced they would look at me and float on the surface. They appeared to be foraging for crabs rather than fish at site #2. I did not have binoculars so it was difficult to see what they were eating but they would often surface chewing something. They stayed at site #2 for 10 minutes and then swam upstream foraging as they swam.<br /><br />I did not observe any voice communication between them and I was suprised as to how white the fur on the lower neck and upper belly was.<br /><br />I believe these are juvenile otters possibly siblings"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.913322,38.232449]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date":"11-Dec-12","Number of Otters":3,"Dead":"","Description":"3-4 River Otters - Napa River.  11 Dec 2012","Notes":"by Jonathan Koehloer:  These otters appeared to have a den or hiding spot in a large debris jam on the bank of the Napa River near a site we were measuring for salmon spawning conditions.

January 29, 2013","Notes":"by Helen Daley:  I was out birdwatching late afternoon just before sunset. I was walking along the Los Gatos Creek bike trail and noticed this animal swimming in the corner of the lake (there are a number of ponds here adjacent to the lake called Oka Ponds). At first I thought it was a tortoise, but when viewing with my binocculars and saw it dive under, it definitely was not a tortoise. I have not seen anything like it before.<br />Notice animal swimming with head only out of water, then it dived under and I saw its tail was thick, tapering to a point, (the whole body appeared streamline. It then popped its head out of the water again, swam another 10 feet then dived under water again close to approaching some tall dead elephant grass on the bank of the lake. After researching online to determine what it was, I am sure it had to be a river otter. It was about the size of a domestic cat. From what I read online and at your site, this otter may be around for a while because it will have a good food supply, clean water and vegetation in this location."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.965668,37.245636]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date":"30-Jan-13","Number of Otters":1,"Dead":"","Description":"1 River Otter - Napa.
